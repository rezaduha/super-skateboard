        "wheels": "Blind 52mm 100a Wheels - A harder wheel that's great for park or street skating because of its forgiveness and ability to slide easily. Rolls very fast on smooth surfaces, but can be less forgiving on rougher ground.",
        "bearings": "ABEC 5 Bearings - Smooth, fast and durable, ABEC 5 bearings are essentially the go-to bearing for most street skaters."
