        "construction": "Traditional 7-Ply - Traditional for a reason. Standard 7-ply wood construction gives you a deck that's durable, sturdy and poppy without breaking the bank.",
        "trucks": "Tensor Trucks - Tensor Trucks feature a hollow kingpin to shave weight, making them light and easily maneuverable.",
        "wheels": "Almost 51mm 83a Wheels - Soft with plenty of grip, but hard enough that sliding through turns and drifting is a breeze. A good cruiser wheel, but more ideal for sliding, you'll be able to ride over rough surfaces without any issues. Also a good filming duro as it's a bit faster than some of the softer varieties.",
        "bearings": "ABEC 5 Bearings - Smooth, fast and durable, ABEC 5 bearings are the go-to bearings for most street skaters."
