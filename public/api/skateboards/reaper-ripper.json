        "construction": "Traditional 7-Ply - Traditional for a reason. Standard 7-ply wood construction gives you a deck that's durable, sturdy and poppy without breaking the bank.",
        "trucks": "Tensor Trucks - Tensor Trucks feature a hollow kingpin to shave weight, making them light, easily maneuverable, and uber poppy.",
        "wheels": "Good for starting out and learning the basics, smoother and less chatter on rough terrain like streets/sidewalks/driveways that almost all kids start skating on. More grip and less sliding out too.",
        "bearings": "ABEC 5 Bearings - Smooth, fast and durable, ABEC 5 bearings are essentially the go-to bearing for most street skaters."
